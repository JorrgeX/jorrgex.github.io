I am currently a Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics, Statistics & Scientific Computation at the University of Maryland. 

I hold dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science as well as Meteorology and Atmospheric Science from the Pennsylvania State University (May 2023). As an undergraduate, I was advised by Dr. [Xingchao Chen](http://www.met.psu.edu/people/xzc55)  on a cross-disciplinary Mesoscale Convective System project, integrating computer science, physical science, and mathematics to create impactful solutions. 


Research Interest
------

With a diverse background, I am interested in exploring advanced domains like data assimilation, numerical analysis, and machine learning within the field.
Eager to further enrich my expertise and contribute to cutting-edge research.
