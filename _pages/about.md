Hello! My name is Yuan-Chih Hsieh.

I am a Ph.D. student in the Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Scientific Computation (AMSC) program at The University of Maryland, College Park. I hold dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science as well as Meteorology and Atmospheric Science from the Pennsylvania State University. As an undergraduate, I was advised by Professor [Xingchao Chen](http://www.met.psu.edu/people/xzc55)  on a cross-disciplinary Mesoscale Convective System project, integrating computer science, physical science, and mathematics to create impactful solutions for the tropical regions. 

Currently, I am advised by Professor [Kayo Ide](https://www2.atmos.umd.edu/~ide/). I am interested in using numerical methods to solve physical problems. I am interested in data assimilation, numerical weather prediction, numerical analysis, machine learning.
